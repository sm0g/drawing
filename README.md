# Console Drawing Program

Build: `gradle clean build`

Run: `gradle run -q --console=plain`

Notes: 
Default 'x' char was used for drawing shapes for now. It's possible to extend functionality
and allow a user to choose any char for drawing.

It possible to use bucket fill with a space char (' '), just add a space after y coordinate and hit Enter.
